# Day 1 of the Code Nation Master Software Bootcamp

I'm thrilled to share that I've embarked on the Code Nation: Master Software Bootcamp! My fascination with coding has led me to this exciting endeavor, marking the beginning of my journey towards becoming a full-stack developer.

The initial hours of the bootcamp were truly engaging. I had the opportunity to connect with the other cohorts who will be collaborating with me on this path, exchanging thoughts and experiences. We also had our first lesson on [HTML & CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), which served as a refreshing reminder of the fundamentals. While I already possess a decent understanding of [HTML & CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), I'm always eager to extend my support to fellow students who may require assistance.

I eagerly anticipate delving deeper into the world of coding and honing my skills. [Collaboration](http://www.codenation.com/collaboration) with my cohorts and the collective building of projects further fuels my excitement. While I acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead, I'm confident in my ability to succeed.

Here's a glimpse into the subjects I'm eagerly anticipating exploring throughout the bootcamp:

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
